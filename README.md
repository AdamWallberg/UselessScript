# UselessScript
"Virtual machine" that parses a humanly readable script, translates it into instructions, and then interprets those.
In other words, a useless custom scripting language. 

The machine, stack, and bytecode works as intended. But the parser is merely a spaghetti-coded test case, since it was never my intention to create an actual scripting language.
